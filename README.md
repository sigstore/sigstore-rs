A crate to interact with [sigstore](https://sigstore.dev/).

This crate is under active development and will not be considered
stable until the 1.0 release.

## Features

### Cosign Sign and Verify

The crate implements the following verification mechanisms:

  * Sign using a cosign key and store the signature in a registry
  * Verify using a given key
  * Verify bundle produced by transparency log (Rekor)
  * Verify signature produced in keyless mode, using Fulcio Web-PKI

Signature annotations and certificate email can be provided at verification time.

### Fulcio Integration

For use with Fulcio ephemeral key signing, an OpenID connect API is available,
along with a fulcio client implementation.

### Rekor Client

All rekor client APIs can be leveraged to interact with the transparency log.

### Key Interface

Cryptographic key management with the following key interfaces:

* Generate a key pair
* Sign data
* Verify signature
* Export public / (encrypted) private key in PEM / DER format
* Import public / (encrypted) private key in PEM / DER format

#### Known limitations

* The crate does not handle verification of attestations yet.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains demo programs using the library.

  * [`openidflow`](examples/openidflow/README.md)
  * [`key_interface`](examples/key_interface/README.md)
  * [`rekor`](examples/rekor/README.md)
  * [`cosign/verify`](examples/cosign/verify/README.md)
  * [`cosign/sign`](examples/cosign/sign/README.md)

Each example can be executed with the `cargo run --example <name>` command.

For example, `openidconnect` can be run with the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example openidconnect
```
